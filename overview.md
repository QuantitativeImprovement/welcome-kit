# Quantitative Improvement Overview

Quantitative Improvement (QI) is a rigorous method for improving team effectiveness over time. It focuses on steady daily progress, rather than risky full-system transformations that take a long time to implement or assess.

The core mental model for QI is:

* **Pragmatism.** Theory is nice. Values can be handy for opening thinking. But in the end, we do whatever works.
* **Incrementalism.** Large changes are expensive and risky. They often have only modest results. Instead, we make a large number of small, easily-reversible changes. Then we keep the ones that work.
* **Precision.** We describe each change precisely. We share specific, reproducible behaviors and results.
* **Experimentalism.** Tradition and habit are but one source of good ideas. We constantly experiment and tweak. Every aspect of the way we work is open to change.
* **Local, temporary measurement.** Each change will have different effects. There is no one set of measures that will always work. We measure the outcomes of each change, but we use the right measures for the specific change. And then we stop measuring that thing once the change is understood.
* **Trust over governance.** The team owns its effectiveness. No one outside the team takes responsibility for the team's effectiveness. The rest of the company trusts the team. And it is the team's responsibility to continually earn that trust, via transparency and good decisions.
