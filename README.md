# Quantitative Improvement (QI) Welcome Kit
A kit for those just getting started with QI. This provides the basic capabilities for a Shu-level transition to the Qualitative Improvement process. The welcome kit assumes you have coach support; this is a tool for a trained QI coach to bring to your team.

## Contents

This kit contains:

* **Iteration overview:** describes the key ceremonies of Quantitative Improvement and what to do when for what purpose.
* **Glossary:** defines key terms and ideas so we can all share the same language.
* **Tracking and Reporting worksheet:** track your actions and analyze your outcomes. Used both for steering within the team and for demonstrating trustworthiness outside of the team (to management).
* **Experiment template:** guides you to the important parts for defining a successful experiment.
* **Improvement template:** guides you to the important parts for planning a successful improvement / habit change.
* **Example board:** shows an effective way to organize the team's planning board so that both Product and Sustainability work get done.

## Additional Resources

These items are useful for starting a new team, but are not included in the welcome kit.

* **A trained QI coach:** generally someone outside your team who can help your team adopt the new behaviors.
* **QI cycle challenges:** guides your gradual adoption / improvement at QI over the 90 days after initial inception by providing one thing every 2 days to notice and improve as part of your normal work.
